### Elevator Pitch

This is a video library where verified users can upload instructional or informational videos. Users will be able to access the site without an account, but will only be able to submit videos publicly by obtaining a verified account. I will also add a comments feature, similar to YouTube, where the comments can be removed by the user who submitted the video.
