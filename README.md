### Elevator Pitch

This is a video library where verified users can upload instructional or informational videos. Users will be able to access the site without an account or by obtaining an unverified account, but will only be able to submit videos publicly by obtaining a verified account.

### Key Features

- "Like"
- Comments by signed-in users
- Comment removal by video submitter
- Flag inappropriate videos

### Using Technologies

1. **Authentication:** Users will be able to create an account and log in. They will also be able to verify their account in order to submit videos to the site. With an unverified account, users will be able to comment on and "Like" videos.
2. **Database Data:** Videos, comments, likes, and flags, as well as the associated user data will have to be stored in and retrieved from a database.
3. **Websocket Data:** Whenever another user posts a video, makes a comment, likes a video, or flags a video, everything will need to be updated in real time.
